# CoffeeWood
CoffeeWood is a programming language coded in Java & C++ and C. This programming language is made for ***adults*** and ***kids***. It works with Android and MacOS and Windows and last but not least Unix/Linux.

CoffeeWood is a simple compiled language. It is compiled when you run the compiler along with your .cw script. Example:

```
cw compiler [script.cw]
cw compiler [script.cw] -quiet
                        ^^^^^^
                        Say no messages from the compiler except for errors and warnings

cw compiler [script.cw] -Verbose.print
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                        Say messages in verbose mode
```
